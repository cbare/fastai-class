# Notes from FastAI Class 2022


## Lesson 3: Neural net foundations

Lesson summary: Demonstrate gradient descent by fitting a quadratic. Introduce ReLUs.

What about the trade-off between inference time and performance? Here's a notebook that tries to answer that question: [Which image models are best?][models]

Side notes: An alternative to Kaggle notebooks, Colab, etc. is [Paperspace Gradient Notebooks][ps]. IPYWidgets [interact][interact].

## Lesson 4: Natural Language (NLP)

Lesson summary: Introduction to NLP using [Hugging Face Transformers][hftransf] and the notebook [Getting started with NLP for absolute beginners][nlpnb].
